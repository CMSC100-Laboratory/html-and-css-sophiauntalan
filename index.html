                <h1>Hello, there! I am Sophia Untalan.</h1>
                <p>UPLB Student | Web Programmer | Python Developer</p>
                <p class="greeting">
                    I am a graduating Computer Science student with a strong passion for frontend development and software engineering. My expertise includes Python, HTML, and CSS, and I also have experience working with C, Java, and R. With a solid technical foundation and a keen eye for design, I strive to build efficient, user-friendly web applications that enhance user experiences. I work well in collaborative environments, valuing teamwork and clear communication to ensure smooth coordination in fast-paced projects.
                    <br><br>
                    Beyond coding, I have a diverse range of interests that have helped shape me into a well-rounded individual. As a varsity futsal athlete, I have developed discipline, resilience, and teamwork, while my participation in pageants and fashion shows has strengthened my confidence and adaptability. These experiences allow me to connect easily with people and take instructions effectively. I am eager to apply for the Frontend Software Engineer position at Gugil Co. because I am passionate about building seamless, interactive user interfaces and believe my skills and experiences will allow me to contribute meaningfully to innovative projects.

                <p>
                    Outside academics, I am a loving daughter of the best mother in the entire world. I was born in Quezon City on February 18, 2005. I first took interest in computer science when my mom encouraged me to learn Python in the Philippine Coding Camp, it was that moment I knew the path I want to walk on. As I prepare for the next chapter of my life, I look forward to new challenges and opportunities that will help me grow more. All glory to God.
