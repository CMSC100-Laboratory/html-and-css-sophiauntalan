○ Steps on how to create GitHub page:  To create a github page, you must have your css, html, and other necessary folders uploaded in your repo. Then, in the pages tab under settings, go to branch, select main, and save. 

○ What are your key takeaways from this exercise?: Some of my main takeaways are: (1) Flexbox, justifying-content, margins, etc. are very handy when it comes to layouting. It's best to get used to it because rearranging the contents of my page took me the longest time. (2) Github is very sensitive in file paths. (3) Github has been very helpful to me, I don't have to send my files to someone else anymore for them to be able to view my web page.
